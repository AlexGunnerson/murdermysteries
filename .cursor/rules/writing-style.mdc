# Writing Style Preferences

## Punctuation: Avoid Em-Dashes

Use commas instead of em-dashes (—) in narrative text.

### Examples

```
❌ BAD: "He was furious—said I'd betrayed the family's trust"
✅ GOOD: "He was furious, said I'd betrayed the family's trust"

❌ BAD: "This is theft—from scholarships for deserving students"
✅ GOOD: "This is theft, from scholarships for deserving students"

❌ BAD: "Colin—my trusted estate manager—tried to sell it"
✅ GOOD: "Colin, my trusted estate manager, tried to sell it"
```

### Exceptions

Em-dashes are acceptable for:
- **Signatures and attributions**: "— R.A." or "— Veronica Ashcombe"
- **Formal document headers**: "ANALYSIS — Q1 1963"
- **Medical notation styles**: "R.A. — 9:10 PM" (professional formatting convention)
