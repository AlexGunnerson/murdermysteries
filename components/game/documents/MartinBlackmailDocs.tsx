      The quarterly payment is late again. I've kept my silence, but my circumstances have changed. I'll need another payment soon — something more substantial this time — or people will start asking questions about where I've been getting my income.

        Martin's affair with Clara — a maid, no less — could have ruined us all. Instead of showing restraint, he compounds his sin by paying her off. Now this woman will bleed him — and by extension, this family — dry. He lacks the spine to handle his own messes, so I must keep yet another shameful secret. Another moral lapse, another stain on the Ashcombe name. How many more, Martin? How many more?
