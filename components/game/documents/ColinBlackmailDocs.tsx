        My mother's ring. The one piece of her I treasured above all else. Colin — my trusted estate manager, my right hand for thirty years — tried to sell it at auction like some common trinket.
      </p>

      <p>
        Charles was browsing Marshall & Hayes' preview catalog and recognized it immediately. "E.A. 1887" — Elizabeth Ashcombe, my grandmother's name and the year she married. He telephoned me straightaway, furious on my behalf.
      </p>

      <p>
        I confronted Colin before the auction could proceed. He claimed "desperate circumstances," gambling debts he'd hidden from me. Desperation doesn't excuse theft. Desperation doesn't excuse betraying three decades of trust.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've kept him on because dismissing him would raise too many questions about why. But my trust is shattered. He manages my affairs, handles my accounts, has keys to everything — and this is how he repays loyalty?
      </p>

      <p>
        He knows I know. That knowledge keeps him in line, for now. But a man who would steal his employer's most precious heirloom — what else is he capable of when cornered?
