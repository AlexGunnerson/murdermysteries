    "title": "Death at the Ashcombe Gala",
    "content": "The Ashcombe Estate rests on a gentle rise above the countryside — an expanse of gardens, glass, and grandeur. Every spring, Reginald Ashcombe's Annual Gala draws the region's most distinguished guests: philanthropists, family friends, and society's polished few.\n\nThis year's gathering was meant to be especially meaningful — Reginald's chance to reaffirm the family's legacy after a season of quiet rumors. The day was perfectly choreographed: luncheon on the lawn, an afternoon greenhouse tour of rare orchids, and an evening gala banquet with charity presentation.\n\nBy nightfall, the air was warm, perfumed with lilacs and wine. Reginald appeared radiant, laughing easily as he greeted guests from the landing.\n\nBut when dawn came, that laughter was gone.\n\nReginald Ashcombe was found lifeless at the bottom of the grand staircase — an apparent accident. A wine glass lay near him, dark liquid pooling across the marble.\n\nThe constable calls it misfortune. The guests murmur condolences.\n\nBut Veronica Ashcombe, his widow, doesn't believe it. She's hired you privately to investigate. She suspects someone in Reginald's inner circle had reason to silence him — but she needs proof before casting accusations.\n\n\"Reginald always said our family's reputation was like fine crystal — beautiful, but fragile. Some things, perhaps, are better left in drawers than dragged into daylight.\"\n\nYour mission: Investigate the scene, question the widow, examine the evidence, and determine if this was truly an accident... or murder."
