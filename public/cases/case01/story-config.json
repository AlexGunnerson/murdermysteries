    "content": "At 11:47 PM last night, wealthy businessman Richard Blackwood was found dead in his study at Blackwood Manor. The cause of death appears to be a gunshot wound to the chest. A revolver was found near the body.\n\nThe initial investigation suggests three possibilities: suicide, accident, or murder. The manor's residents claim to have been elsewhere at the time of death, but their stories don't quite add up.\n\nYour mission: Question the suspects, investigate the crime scene, review the evidence, and determine what really happened that night.\n\nYou have 25 Detective Points to work with. Use them wisely - every action has a cost, but discovering new facts will earn you more points."

The embezzlement, the staged suicide, the carefully constructed alibi - it all falls apart under your investigation.\n\nWhen confronted with your evidence, Marcus finally breaks down and confesses. The threatening letter, the forensic evidence, and James's testimony all paint a clear picture. Marcus arrived that night for one last plea to save the partnership. When Richard refused and threatened to expose everything, Marcus snapped.\n\nJustice will be served. Richard Blackwood's family can finally have closure, knowing the truth about that terrible night at Blackwood Manor.",
    "narrativeIncorrect": "Not quite, Detective.\n\n{incorrect_accusation_feedback}\n\nThe real killer was Marcus Sterling. Driven by financial desperation and fear of exposure for his embezzlement, he murdered Richard and carefully staged it as suicide. The evidence was there: Marcus's presence at the manor that night (witnessed by James), the forensic evidence showing it wasn't suicide, and the financial records revealing his motive.\n\nSometimes the truth is hidden in the details we overlook. Better luck on your next case."
